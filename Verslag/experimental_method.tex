\section{Experimental Method}

No experiments were carried out for this report, but measurements from previous students are used. The experimental set-up that they used and the computer algorithms that were used for this report will be discussed in this section.

The experimental set-up that was used for this report can be seen in figure \ref{fig_setup}. 
According to the practicum manual, the red light from the laser has a wavelength of Î»=658 nm and passes through a beam expander in order to completely fill the back (back focal plane) of the objective. 
The mirrors M1 and M2 are used for compacting the beam path and aligning the beam to the optical axis of the objective. 
The used objective is meant to be used in an infinity corrected microscope. 
L4 focusses the light back to an image at focal distance. 
In the set-up, the L1 and L2 have focal length of respectively 50 and 350 mm. The front focal distance of the objective lens is 1.8 mm and the second objective lens has a focal length of 200 mm. Using simple division and equation \ref{eq_error} we find that the magnification is  $ M = \frac{200}{1.8} = 1.1  \: \pm 0.3 \cdot 10^2$. Given the pixel size of the camera of $ 5.2 \: \mu $  and equation  \ref{eq_error} we find that the conversion factor for pixels to length is given by $l_{pixel} = \frac{5.2}{M} \cdot 10^{-6} \approx 4.7 \; \pm 0.1 \; \cdot 10^{-8} m/pixel$.
