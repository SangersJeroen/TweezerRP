\section{Discussion}
In the previous section the results were presented and even though some points of the first dataset were not really usable, a clear relation between the laser output power and the trap stiffness of the optical trap was found. Both of the datasets showed a linear relation between the trap stiffnesses in the $x$- and $y$-direction and the laser output power $P$ and between the total trap stiffness $k_{tot}$ and the laser output power.\\
The task of recreating a MATLAB script in Python was partially successful. The symmetry centre finding function was successfully implemented as well as the subpixel interpolation function. Due to some dissimilarities in the way MATLAB and Python functions interpolate an unstructured set of data we were unable to get the main tracking function to work. The resulting estimates of the symmetry centre location were not far of but were not dead-on either.\\
