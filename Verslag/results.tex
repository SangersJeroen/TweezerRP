\subsection{Results of the datasets}
The results of the MATLAB code calculating $k_{trap,x}$ and $k_{trap,y}$ for the two data sets are presented in table \ref{tab:first-results}. Since the MATLAB code failed to track the bead for some of the measurements in the first data set, not all values are used for fitting. The second dataset was much better and did not have any faulty measurements, its values are shown in table \ref{tab:second-results}.\\

We cannot calculate the exact value of the error since the MATLAB algorithm does not provide us with the locations and its error. However, if we estimate the error of the bead location to be $u_{xi} = \frac{l_pixel}{2}$ and we know that 1000 frames were used for the calculation of the trap constants we find from equation \ref{eq_u_k_consant} that $u_{k_{trap}} = l_pixel (k_B T)^{\frac{1}{2}}  k_{trap} ^{\frac{3}{2}}$.

The data shown above in tables \ref{tab:first-results} and \ref{tab:second-results} are plotted in figures \ref{fig:bead-plot} and \ref{fig:trap-plot} re\-spectively. In the plots the in\-divi\-dual data points and their cor\-responding error flags are shown as well as the least squares fit of these data points for the $k_x$, $k_y$ and $k_{tot}$ values. The fit of the $k_{tot}$ values is plotted on a secondary axis.\\
The resulting values of $\alpha$ for the least squares fit to the function $k_{trap}= \alpha \cdot P$  are shown below in table \ref{tab:fit-results}.\\

\subsection{Python program results}
During this practical we were also tasked with rewriting a MATLAB script in to Python. The piece of script we needed to rewrite was the function that tracks the centre of the bead in the image, this function was comprised of interpolation method and a method that found the symmetry centre of the bead using Fourier transforms. The second part was easily implemented in Python as it was mostly just finding the right Python functions that were equivalent to their MATLAB counterparts. The interpolation function was a lot harder to implement in Python since most of the existing Python interpolation functions did not have the same functionality. The documentation of this part of the practical can be found in the appendix\\

As outlined in the section \ref{trap_constant} a method for deriving the trap constants was proposed that differs from the one from the MATLAB script. This method was implemented in a second different python script to try and show its usefulness. This python script can be found in the appendix.\
\
 The result speaks for itself, it shows a clear connection between the laser output power and the length of the semi-major and semi-minor axis of the ellipses that encircle the points describing the symmetry centres of the beads. The points were fitted with a function with shape $L_{axis}=a\cdot e^{-b\cdot P}$, this seems to fit well as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:spread-bead-plot} \& \ref{fig:spread-trap-plot}. This also shows that while the trap stiffness seems to increase linearly with the laser power the area of the ellipse in which we expect a bead to be found decreases exponentially with laser power. In the appendix three more plots showing the spread can be seen.
